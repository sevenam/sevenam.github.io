I mostly go by JB as my real name is long and doesn't work too well internationally. \
I live in Norway and currently write code for the company Cegal. \
I mostly work in the .NET space but also spice it up with some javascript/typescript/python and stuff. \
For many years I've been writing private notes for my own use, but it's time to share them online. \
Maybe they'll be useful for someone else too...

My github account can be found on the link below. Not really anything too useful there though. \
